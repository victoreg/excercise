1)
- Create methods to decide if log to console, file or database
- not read all the text file each time we write a new log event
- better than ReadAllText is use AppendAllText for just add the new log event, but instead use both of them is use StreamWriter
- use asynchronus methods, WriteAsync and WriteLineAsync for work with I/O files operations
- use try/catch around operations that could got exceptions, like read/write file or open connection to database and get data from it
- use "using" when will do operations with database or files to ensure manage a scope for the objects will be disposed.
